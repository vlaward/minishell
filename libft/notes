This is just gonna be note for what I change since the libft I pushed : 

Lists :

-I added a "ft_lstblast" To hae the element before the last one in a list.
-Inverse ft_lstadd_back and ft_lstadd_front, the name were messed up for me.
-ft_lstante return the node before the one add in parameter. If it's the first node, return the last node (like, doing a full circle).
-In ft_lstadd_(front/back) if the lst is one element longue it would circle. I patched it.
-In ft_strncmp, added ft_strcmp. To compare without needing the length.
-Added "ft_isin_table" to test if a value is in a table (may change it to isin mem with void pointer instead of int).
-Added "ft_lstnodi" to find the node at a certain index (usefull sometimes).
-added "ft_strjoin_n_free" that free both part of the join
-Added "strndup", stdup avec une size

Others :

-added "ft_mapi" to do an action on all of a table elements (typically free all of a **char).

To_do;
-ft_insin_mem.
-Secure all fuctions.
-find a new name for "ft_mapi" (or verify this name doesn't mean what it doesn't do). <- is in ft_strmapi.c

-actually correct ft_mapi, it doesn't work ;-; it's the "void" type, I don't mean norhing but wathever. it'as annoying

-Coorect ft_split, it need to have a \0 at the end of each str wich he don't have. (=-= this is false ?? I mean I'll verify but it doesn't seem right)

-Make all the void function into int return to make test. And secure each case (if the args used are incorecte)

-Differenciate differente part of the lib to make litles ones. And then a big one :
	->like having libft_str and libft_lst and libft_memory and merge the 3 in a libft
	->So having 3 makes different. make str, make lst, and make meme.


lmao I let that here it's funny. and add shit to help with subtree
==========
"THIS IS JUSTE A TEST FOR THE GIT SUBTREE"
"and another one"
==========

subtree commands : 
	git subtree pull --prefix libft/ git@github.com:vlaward/libft.git main --squash
	git subtree push --prefix libft/ git@github.com:vlaward/libft.git main

git branchs : (not sure about that. Modifie stv, je coco pas nn plus)
branchs list normalement :
    ->main   ;   Nahla    ;   Maya
  command :
    git branch <name> == ajoute une branche
    git checkout <name> == tu passe sur la branche 'name'
    git branch --list == self explenatory
    git merge <branch> == merge la branche "branch" dans la branche actuel (souvent main du coup)

-> cat Makefile > txt ; cat txt = le prompt n'est pas a la ligne
